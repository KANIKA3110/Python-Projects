Â© Kanika Joshi

Description: A GUI based contact book that allows user to add, remove, update and display name and phone no of a contact in SQL database. 
Error handling is done so that no field can stay empty or consist of only spaces and phone no must be of 10 digits etc. 

Project highlight: A calling feature is provided which uses ADB connect service to call someone from the phone connected to the system using USB Cable. 
You can call either a saved contact by searching name or you can type the phone no. 

Prerequisites: 
Phone must be connected to charging only and USB Debugging must be "ON" in developer options. 
System must have adb connect installed
